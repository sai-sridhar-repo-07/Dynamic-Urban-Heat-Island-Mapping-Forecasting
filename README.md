# Dynamic-Urban-Heat-Island-Mapping-Forecasting

# The Problem
Urban Heat Islands (UHIs) are areas in cities that are significantly warmer than surrounding rural areas. This phenomenon exacerbates a number of problems, including increased energy consumption, elevated health risks for residents, and environmental degradation. The primary challenge is that most cities lack the ability to predict UHI effects at a granular, neighborhood-level scale in real-time.

# Project Uniqueness
This project offers a unique and advanced solution by combining three distinct data modalities to create a highly accurate and actionable model. Its key differentiators include:

# Multi-Modal Data Integration
It goes beyond single data sources by fusing satellite imagery, weather data, and urban infrastructure data to create a comprehensive understanding of heat vulnerability.

# Hyper-Local Predictions
The model is designed to provide heat vulnerability predictions at a fine-grained, neighborhood or even street level, rather than broad city-level averages.

# Direct Application
The deliverables are built for immediate use by governments, NGOs, and urban planners, providing them with a powerful tool for informed decision-making and climate resilience strategies.

# Project Breakdown
# 1. Data Collection
The project relies on a diverse set of open-source and public APIs to gather the necessary data:

# Satellite Data
We will use Landsat 8/9 satellite data from NASA, specifically leveraging the thermal infrared bands to calculate land surface temperature.

# Meteorological Data
The OpenWeatherMap API will be used to collect real-time and historical data on key weather variables such as temperature, humidity, and wind speed.

# Urban Infrastructure Data
Data from OpenStreetMap (OSM) will be used to extract features related to urban form, including green cover, building density, and water body locations.

# 2. Feature Engineering
From the raw data, we will engineer a robust set of features to train the models:

# Satellite-Derived Features:

Land Surface Temperature: A direct measure of heat.

NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index): A measure of vegetation density, which is a key factor in cooling urban areas.

Albedo: The reflectivity of a surface, indicating how much solar energy it absorbs.

Urban Infrastructure Features:

Building Footprints & Density: The amount of built-up area, which contributes to heat absorption.

Road Density: The concentration of paved surfaces that retain heat.

Green Cover & Water Bodies: The presence of cooling elements in the urban landscape.

Time Series Features:

Historical Meteorological Data: Trends and patterns in temperature, humidity, and wind over time.

# 3. Modeling Approach
The core of the project's intelligence lies in a sophisticated, hybrid modeling strategy:

Hybrid CNN + Gradient Boosting Model:

A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) will be trained to extract deep spatial features from the satellite imagery (e.g., patterns of temperature, NDVI, and albedo).

A Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) or LightGBM will be used to handle the tabular data from weather APIs and urban infrastructure.

The features from both models will be concatenated and fed into a final classification layer to produce a comprehensive UHI vulnerability score for a given area.

# Time Series Forecasting:

An LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) or Temporal Fusion Transformer model will be used to analyze historical meteorological and UHI data.

This model will be trained to forecast future UHI intensity for the next day or week, providing valuable predictive capabilities.

# 4. Key Deliverables
Upon completion, the project will yield the following outputs:

A High-Resolution UHI Map: A detailed, visually intuitive map of a target city, highlighting areas of high heat vulnerability.

A Predictive Model: A deployable model capable of forecasting UHI intensity with a defined temporal horizon.

# Actionable Insights: 
Analysis demonstrating the direct correlation between urban features (e.g., tree cover vs. building density) and UHI effects, providing a scientific basis for policy and planning decisions.
